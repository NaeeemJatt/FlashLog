# FlashLog Security Documentation

## Critical Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed Hardcoded Credentials
- **Before**: Admin password was hardcoded as "jatt"
- **After**: Admin password uses environment variable `ADMIN_PASSWORD` with secure default
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized admin access

### 2. ✅ Fixed Weak Secret Key
- **Before**: Secret key was hardcoded as "supersecretkey"
- **After**: Uses `secrets.token_hex(32)` to generate cryptographically secure key
- **Impact**: Prevents session hijacking and CSRF attacks

### 3. ✅ Added CSRF Protection
- **Before**: No CSRF protection
- **After**: Flask-WTF CSRF protection on all forms
- **Impact**: Prevents cross-site request forgery attacks

### 4. ✅ Added Rate Limiting
- **Before**: No rate limiting
- **After**: Flask-Limiter with configurable limits
- **Impact**: Prevents brute force attacks and DoS

### 5. ✅ Strengthened Password Policy
- **Before**: 6 character minimum
- **After**: 12 character minimum with complexity requirements
- **Impact**: Prevents weak password attacks

### 6. ✅ Added Input Validation
- **Before**: Minimal input validation
- **After**: Comprehensive validation and sanitization
- **Impact**: Prevents injection attacks and XSS

### 7. ✅ Added Security Headers
- **Before**: Basic headers only
- **After**: Comprehensive security headers including CSP
- **Impact**: Prevents various client-side attacks

### 8. ✅ Fixed Debug Mode
- **Before**: Debug mode enabled in production
- **After**: Debug mode controlled by environment variable
- **Impact**: Prevents information disclosure

### 9. ✅ Added File Upload Security
- **Before**: No file type or size validation
- **After**: File type and size restrictions enforced
- **Impact**: Prevents malicious file uploads

### 10. ✅ Added Account Lockout
- **Before**: No account lockout protection
- **After**: Account locked after 5 failed attempts for 15 minutes
- **Impact**: Prevents brute force attacks

### 11. ✅ Added Centralized Error Handling
- **Before**: Detailed error messages in debug mode
- **After**: Custom error pages with minimal information
- **Impact**: Prevents information disclosure

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file based on `env_example.txt`:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourSecureAdminPassword123!
```

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 12 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

### Rate Limiting
- Default: 200 requests per day, 50 per hour
- Login: 5 attempts per minute
- Configurable via environment variables

### Session Security
- Secure session cookies (enable in production)
- HTTP-only cookies
- SameSite protection
- Automatic session refresh

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Never commit secrets to version control
2. Use environment variables for sensitive data
3. Regularly update dependencies
4. Follow secure coding practices
5. Implement proper error handling

### For Administrators
1. Change default admin password immediately
2. Use HTTPS in production
3. Enable secure session cookies
4. Monitor access logs
5. Regular security audits

### For Users
1. Use strong, unique passwords
2. Enable two-factor authentication if available
3. Log out when finished
4. Report suspicious activity
5. Keep browsers updated

## Security Headers Implemented

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - XSS protection
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - HTTPS enforcement
- `Content-Security-Policy` - Content security policy

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Events Logged
- Login attempts (success/failure)
- Password changes
- User creation/deletion
- Admin actions
- Failed authentication attempts

### Recommended Monitoring
- Failed login attempts
- Unusual access patterns
- Admin privilege changes
- File upload activities
- Session anomalies

## Incident Response

### If Compromise is Suspected
1. Immediately change admin password
2. Review access logs
3. Check for unauthorized changes
4. Reset affected user sessions
5. Update security measures
